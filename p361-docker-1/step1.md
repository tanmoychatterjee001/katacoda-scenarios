# Create Own Docker Image

In P361 a team member by the name Ross Rossum recently joined. He is an expert in R and Python programming language.
He has more than decades experience in coding in R and Python. 

He has been assigned the first task of proving that multiplication of floating point numbers behave differently in R and 
in Python. However he has to ensure that his code runs on his team members' system. Unfortunately all his team members are either who are either R or Python experts and do not have both R and Python installed on their systems.
Ross Rossum is also quite new to the Docker world.


He would like to use the following code for R

`create `

and the following code for python

`ddfsdfsd`

After which he would like to run these 2 codes one after the other and see the results

Can you help him in creating a single docker image with the follwing contents:
* base-r  https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base
*
